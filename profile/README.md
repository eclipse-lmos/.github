## üëã Welcome to Eclipse LMOS

Eclipse LMOS is paving the way for an Internet of Agents (IoA) ‚Äî an internet-scale multi-agent system where AI agents and tools from different organizations can be easily published, discovered, and interconnected, regardless of the technologies they are built on. 

To realize this, Eclipse LMOS incorporates well-established W3C protocols and patterns from the Internet of Things (IoT), adapting them to the realm of web-based multi-agent systems. This adaptation is formalized in the [LMOS Protocol](https://eclipse.dev/lmos/docs/lmos_protocol/introduction/), which builds upon the [W3C Web of Things (WoT) architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/). By leveraging WoT's standardized metadata and abstraction layers, LMOS ensures discoverability, interoperability and transport protocol flexibility for AI agents and tools.

On top, Eclipse LMOS provides an open-source, vendor-neutral [cloud platform](https://eclipse.dev/lmos/docs/lmos_protocol/introduction/) to build and run enterprise-ready multi-agent systems on cloud or on-prem.

## üöÄ What Makes Eclipse LMOS Special?

- **LMOS Protocol**: A protocol which standardizes interaction patterns, metadata and information models, and a communication protocols
- **Multi-Agent Platform**: A cloud platform to develop and operate multi-agent systems.
- **Cloud-Native Scalability**: Leveraging Kubernetes, LMOS ensures cloud-native scalability of Agent deployments
- **Open Standards**: Built on established W3C open standards to ensure interoperability
- **Multi-Tenant Capability**: Built with enterprises in mind, LMOS can manages multiple tenants and agent groups within the same infrastructur

## üåü Key Features

- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Create, deploy and monitor AI agents
- **Meta Communication Protocol**: Transport-protocol agnostic meta protocol for inter-agent communication
- **Deployment Lifecycle Management**: LMOS enables real-world deployment strategies like canary releases
- **Open and extensible Platform**: LMOS allows the integration of Agents developed in frameworks like Agent ReaCtor (ARC), Langchain4j, LlamaIndex or LangChain.
- **Development Tools**: LMOS provides a framework called Agent ReaCtor (ARC) that abstracts the complexities of developing Agents
